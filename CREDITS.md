## PICO-8 Cartridge Attribution

This project includes PICO-8 cartridges that are not created by me.

-   Due to issues hosting on Vercel and the absence of clear official sources or licensing information for these specific demo `.p8.png` cartridges, Iâ€™ve included them directly in this GitHub repository for ease of access and demonstration purposes only.

-   `wander.p8.png` and `waves.p8.png` demo cartridges are from the [PICO-8 Educational Edition](https://www.pico-8-edu.com/), created by [Zep](https://x.com/lexaloffle), the original PICO-8 creator. If you are the original creator or have licensing info, please contact me for proper attribution or removal.

-   This inclusion is meant solely for educational and non-commercial use.
